Before sending the project for review, create a README.md file in the website root directory.
Please include the following information in it:
Project name
Project description. Describe the functionality, as well as the technologies used
Plans for finalizing the project, if any. Be specific. Rather than simply writing "refactor code," say something like "fix X using Y in order to get Z." The more detail, the better
